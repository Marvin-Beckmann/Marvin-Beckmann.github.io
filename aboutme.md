title: About me

Hi there!
I am currently doing my PhD in the Cybersecurity Engineering Section at [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/), the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english).
I got hooked by Cryptography in my 5th Bachelor term and have been 
going with it ever since.
During my Bachelor and Master at Paderborn University, I mainly looked at authentication mechanisms based lattices.

Currently I am mainly interested in privacy-preserving authentication mechanisms.
Specifically those that are required for deniable authenticated key exchange.
I find the contrast between authentication and privacy-preservation to be very interesting.
